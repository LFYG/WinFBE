Code by FreeBASIC
By Kuan Hsu(Yung Kuan Hsu), 2016

It's name is "easy parser" because of it is design for create the AST tree for aucomplete/calltip in my IDE, it lacks error report and syntax analysis isn't very exact, so "EASY" is mean "NOT EXACT"......^^

The sources archive include poseidonFB's project file, it can be easy to read/edit/compile using poseidonFB.
