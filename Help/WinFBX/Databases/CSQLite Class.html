<h1 id="csqlite-class">CSQLite Class</h1>
<p>SQLite is an embedded SQL database engine. Unlike most other SQL databases, SQLite does not have a separate server process. SQLite reads and writes directly to ordinary disk files. A complete SQL database with multiple tables, indices, triggers, and views, is contained in a single disk file. The database file format is cross-platform - you can freely copy a database between 32-bit and 64-bit systems or between big-endian and little-endian architectures. These features make SQLite a popular choice as an Application File Format.</p>

<p>The database is opened for reading and writing, and is created if it does not already exist. If the filename is &quot;:memory:&quot;, then a private, temporary in-memory database is created for the connection. This in-memory database will vanish when the database connection is closed. If the filename is an empty string, then a private, temporary on-disk database will be created. This private database will be automatically deleted as soon as the database connection is closed. If URI filename interpretation is enabled, and the filename argument begins with &quot;file:&quot;, then the filename is interpreted as a URI.</p>

<p>This method is useful during command-line input to determine if the currently entered text seems to form a complete SQL statement or if additional input is needed before sending the text into SQLite for parsing. This method returns 1 if the input string appears to be a complete SQL statement. A statement is judged to be complete if it ends with a semicolon token and is not a prefix of a well-formed CREATE TRIGGER statement. Semicolons that are embedded within string literals or quoted identifier names or comments are not independent tokens (they are part of the token in which they are embedded) and thus do not count as a statement terminator. Whitespace and comments that follow the final semicolon are ignored.</p>
<p>This method does not parse the SQL statements thus will not detect syntactically incorrect SQL.</p>

<h4 id="remarks-10">Remarks</h4>
<p>This method is used to retrieve runtime status information about the performance of SQLite, and optionally to reset various highwater marks. The first argument is an integer code for the specific parameter to measure. Recognized integer codes are of the form SQLITE_STATUS_.... The current value of the parameter is returned into <em>pCurrent</em>. The highest recorded value is returned in <em>pHighwater</em>. If the <em>resetFlag</em> is true, then the highest record value is reset after <em>pHighwater</em> is written. Some parameters do not record the highest value.

<p>This function is threadsafe but is not atomic. This function can be called while other threads are running the same or different SQLite interfaces.

<h4 id="return-value-14">Return value</h4>
<p>TRUE or FALSE.</p>
<h4 id="remarks-11">Remarks</h4>
<p>SQLite can be compiled with or without mutexes. When the SQLITE_THREADSAFE C preprocessor macro is 1 or 2, mutexes are enabled and SQLite is threadsafe. When the SQLITE_THREADSAFE macro is 0, the mutexes are omitted. Without the mutexes, it is not safe to use SQLite concurrently from more than one thread.</p>
<p>Enabling mutexes incurs a measurable performance penalty. So if speed is of utmost importance, it makes sense to disable the mutexes. But for maximum safety, mutexes should be enabled. The default behavior is for mutexes to be enabled.</p>

<h1 id="changes"><a name="Changes"></a>Changes</h1>
<p>This method returns the number of database rows that were changed or inserted or deleted by the most recently completed SQL statement on the current database connection.</p>
<pre><code>FUNCTION Changes () AS LONG
</code></pre>
<h4 id="return-value-17">Return value</h4>
<p>The number of changes.</p>
<h4 id="ks">ks</h4>
<p>Only changes that are directly specified by the INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement are counted. Auxiliary changes caused by triggers or foreign key actions are not counted. Use the <strong>Changes</strong> method to find the total number of changes including changes caused by triggers and foreign key actions.</p>
<p>Changes to a view that are simulated by an INSTEAD OF trigger are not counted. Only real table changes are counted.</p>
<p>A &quot;row change&quot; is a change to a single row of a single table caused by an INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE statement. Rows that are changed as side effects of REPLACE constraint resolution, rollback, ABORT processing, DROP TABLE, or by any other mechanisms do not count as direct row changes.</p>
<p>A &quot;trigger context&quot; is a scope of execution that begins and ends with the script of a trigger. Most SQL statements are evaluated outside of any trigger. This is the &quot;top level&quot; trigger context. If a trigger fires from the top level, a new trigger context is entered for the duration of that one trigger. Subtriggers create subcontexts for their duration.</p>
<p>Calling <strong>Exec</strong> or <strong>Step_</strong> recursively does not create a new trigger context.</p>
<p>This method returns the number of direct row changes in the most recent INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement within the same trigger context.</p>
<p>Thus, when called from the top level, this function returns the number of changes in the most recent INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE that also occurred at the top level. Within the body of a trigger, the <strong>Changes</strong> method can be called to find the number of changes in the most recently completed INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement within the body of the same trigger. However, the number returned does not include changes caused by subtriggers since those have their own context.</p>

<p>Applications must finalize all prepared statements and close all BLOB handles associated with the sqlite3 object prior to attempting to close the object. If <strong>CloseDb</strong> is called on a database connection that still has outstanding prepared statements or BLOB handles, then it returns SQLITE_BUSY.</p>
<p>If <strong>CloseDb</strong> is invoked while a transaction is open, the transaction is automatically rolled back.</p>
<h1 id="errcode"><a name="ErrCode"></a>ErrCode</h1>
<p>Returns the numeric result code for the most recent failed sqlite3 call associated with a database connection. If a prior API call failed but the most recent API call succeeded, the return value from <strong>ErrCode</strong> is undefined.</p>

<h4 id="return-value-19">Return value</h4>
<p>The error code.</p>
<h4 id="remarks-13">Remarks</h4>
<p>When the serialized threading mode is in use, it might be the case that a second error occurs on a separate thread in between the time of the first error and the call to these functions.

<p>This function causes any pending database operation to abort and return at its earliest opportunity. This function is typically called in response to a user action such as pressing &quot;Cancel&quot; or Ctrl-C where the user wants a long query operation to halt immediately.</p>
<pre><code>SUB Interrupt
</code></pre>
<h4 id="remarks-15">Remarks</h4>
<p>It is safe to call this function from a thread different from the thread that is currently running the database operation. But it is not safe to call this function with a database connection that is closed or might close before <strong>Interrupt</strong> returns.</p>
<p>If an SQL operation is very nearly finished at the time when <strong>Interrupt</strong> is called, then it might not have an opportunity to be interrupted and might continue to completion.</p>
<p>An SQL operation that is interrupted will return SQLITE_INTERRUPT. If the interrupted SQL operation is an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE that is inside an explicit transaction, then the entire transaction will be rolled back automatically.</p>
<p>The <strong>Interrupt</strong> call is in effect until all currently running SQL statements on database connection complete. Any new SQL statements that are started after the <strong>Interrupt</strong> call and before the running statements reaches zero are interrupted as if they had been running prior to the <strong>Interrupt</strong> call. New SQL statements that are started after the running statement count reaches zero are not effected by the <strong>Interrupt</strong>. A call to <strong>Interrupt</strong> that occurs when there are no running SQL statements is a no-op and has no effect on SQL statements that are started after the <strong>Interrupt</strong> call returns.</p>
<p>If the database connection closes while <strong>Interrupt</strong> is running then bad things will likely happen.</p>
<h1 id="lastinsertrowid"><a name="LastInsertRowId"></a>LastInsertRowId</h1>
<p>Returns the rowid of the most recent successful INSERT into the database from the database connection in the first argument.</p>
<pre><code>FUNCTION LastInsertRowId () AS sqlite3_int64
</code></pre>
<h4 id="return-value-24">Return value</h4>
<p>The rowid of the most recent successful INSERT into the database from the database connection in the first argument.</p>
<h4 id="remarks-16">Remarks</h4>
<p>Each entry in an SQLite table has a unique 64-bit signed integer key called the &quot;rowid&quot;. The rowid is always available as an undeclared column named ROWID, OID, or <em>ROWID</em> as long as those names are not also used by explicitly declared columns. If the table has a column of type INTEGER PRIMARY KEY then that column is another alias for the rowid.</p>
<p>This function returns the rowid of the most recent successful INSERT into the database from the database connection in the first argument. As of SQLite version 3.7.7, this functions records the last insert rowid of both ordinary tables and virtual tables. If no successful INSERTs have ever occurred on that database connection, zero is returned.</p>
<p>If an INSERT occurs within a trigger or within a virtual table method, then this function will return the rowid of the inserted row as long as the trigger or virtual table method is running. But once the trigger or virtual table method ends, the value returned by this function reverts to what it was before the trigger or virtual table method began.</p>
<p>An INSERT that fails due to a constraint violation is not a successful INSERT and does not change the value returned by this function. Thus INSERT OR FAIL, INSERT OR IGNORE, INSERT OR ROLLBACK, and INSERT OR ABORT make no changes to the return value of this function when their insertion fails. When INSERT OR REPLACE encounters a constraint violation, it does not fail. The INSERT continues to completion after deleting rows that caused the constraint problem so INSERT OR REPLACE will always change the return value of this interface.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this function, an INSERT is considered to be successful even if it is subsequently rolled back.</p>
<p>This function is accessible to SQL statements via the <strong>last_insert_rowid</strong> SQL function.</p>
<p>If a separate thread performs a new INSERT on the same database connection while the <strong>LastInsertRowid</strong> function is running and thus changes the last insert rowid, then the value returned by <strong>LastInsertRowid</strong> is unpredictable and might not equal either the old or the new last insert rowid.</p>
<h1 id="limit"><a name="Limit"></a>Limit</h1>

</table>
<h4 id="return-value-25">Return value</h4>
<p>The prior value of the limit.</p>
<h4 id="remarks-17">Remarks</h4>
<p>If the new limit is a negative number, the limit is unchanged. For each limit category SQLITE_LIMIT_NAME there is a hard upper bound set at compile-time by a C preprocessor macro called SQLITE_MAX_NAME. (The &quot;<em>LIMIT</em>&quot; in the name is changed to &quot;<em>MAX</em>&quot;.) Attempts to increase a limit above its hard upper bound are silently truncated to the hard upper bound.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not the limit was changed, the <strong>Limit</strong> interface returns the prior value of the limit. Hence, to find the current value of a limit without changing it, simply invoke this interface with the third parameter set to -1.</p>
<p>Run-time limits are intended for use in applications that manage both their own internal database and also databases that are controlled by untrusted external sources. An example application might be a web browser that has its own databases for storing history and separate databases controlled by JavaScript applications downloaded off the Internet. The internal databases can be given the large, default limits. Databases managed by external sources can be given much smaller limits designed to prevent a denial of service attack.</p>
<p>New run-time limit categories may be added in future releases.</p>

<p>Unless deadlock is detected (see below), UnlockNotify always returns SQLITE_OK.</p>
<h4 id="remarks-22">Remarks</h4>
<p>Shared-cache locks are released when a database connection concludes its current transaction, either by committing it or rolling it back.</p>
<p>When a connection (known as the blocked connection) fails to obtain a shared-cache lock and SQLITE_LOCKED is returned to the caller, the identity of the database connection (the blocking connection) that has locked the required resource is stored internally. After an application receives an SQLITE_LOCKED error, it may call the <strong>UnlockNotify</strong> method with the blocked connection handle as the first argument to register for a callback that will be invoked when the blocking connections current transaction is concluded. The callback is invoked from within the <strong>Step_</strong> or <strong>Close</strong> call that concludes the blocking connections transaction.</p>
<p>If <strong>UnlockNotify</strong> is called in a multi-threaded application, there is a chance that the blocking connection will have already concluded its transaction by the time <strong>UnlockNotify</strong> is invoked. If this happens, then the specified callback is invoked immediately, from within the call to <strong>UnlockNotify</strong>.</p>
<p>If the blocked connection is attempting to obtain a write-lock on a shared-cache table, and more than one other connection currently holds a read-lock on the same table, then SQLite arbitrarily selects one of the other connections to use as the blocking connection.</p>
<p>There may be at most one unlock-notify callback registered by a blocked connection. If <strong>UnlockNotify</strong> is called when the blocked connection already has a registered unlock-notify callback, then the new callback replaces the old. If <strong>UnlockNotify</strong> is called with a NULL pointer as its second argument, then any existing unlock-notify callback is canceled. The blocked connections unlock-notify callback may also be canceled by closing the blocked connection using <strong>Close</strong>.</p>
<p>The unlock-notify callback is not reentrant. If an application invokes any <strong>sqlite3_xxx</strong> API functions from within an unlock-notify callback, a crash or deadlock may be the result.</p>
<h4 id="callback-invocation-details">Callback Invocation Details</h4>
<p>When an unlock-notify callback is registered, the application provides a single void* pointer that is passed to the callback when it is invoked. However, the signature of the callback function allows SQLite to pass it an array of void* context pointers. The first argument passed to an unlock-notify callback is a pointer to an array of void* pointers, and the second is the number of entries in the array.</p>
<p>When a blocking connections transaction is concluded, there may be more than one blocked connection that has registered for an unlock-notify callback. If two or more such blocked connections have specified the same callback function, then instead of invoking the callback function multiple times, it is invoked once with the set of void* context pointers specified by the blocked connections bundled together into an array. This gives the application an opportunity to prioritize any actions related to the set of unblocked database connections.</p>
<h4 id="deadlock-detection">Deadlock Detection</h4>
<p>Assuming that after registering for an unlock-notify callback a database waits for the callback to be issued before taking any further action (a reasonable assumption), then using this API may cause the application to deadlock. For example, if connection X is waiting for connection Y's transaction to be concluded, and similarly connection Y is waiting on connection X's transaction, then neither connection will proceed and the system may remain deadlocked indefinitely.</p>
<p>To avoid this scenario, the <strong>UnlockNotify</strong> performs deadlock detection. If a given call to <strong>UnlockNotify</strong> would put the system in a deadlocked state, then SQLITE_LOCKED is returned and no unlock-notify callback is registered. The system is said to be in a deadlocked state if connection A has registered for an unlock-notify callback on the conclusion of connection B's transaction, and connection B has itself registered for an unlock-notify callback when connection A's transaction is concluded. Indirect deadlock is also detected, so the system is also considered to be deadlocked if connection B has registered for an unlock-notify callback on the conclusion of connection C's transaction, where connection C is waiting on connection A. Any number of levels of indirection are allowed.</p>
<h4 id="the-&quot;drop-table&quot;-exception">The &quot;DROP TABLE&quot; Exception</h4>
<p>When a call to <strong>Step_</strong> returns SQLITE_LOCKED, it is almost always appropriate to call <strong>UnlockNotify</strong>. There is however, one exception. When executing a &quot;DROP TABLE&quot; or &quot;DROP INDEX&quot; statement, SQLite checks if there are any currently executing SELECT statements that belong to the same connection. If there are, SQLITE_LOCKED is returned. In this case there is no &quot;blocking connection&quot;, so invoking <strong>UnlockNotify</strong> results in the unlock-notify callback being invoked immediately. If the application then re-attempts the &quot;DROP TABLE&quot; or &quot;DROP INDEX&quot; query, an infinite loop might be the result.</p>
<p>One way around this problem is to check the extended error code returned by an <strong>Step_</strong> call. If there is a blocking connection, then the extended error code is set to SQLITE_LOCKED_SHAREDCACHE. Otherwise, in the special &quot;DROP TABLE/INDEX&quot; case, the extended error code is just SQLITE_LOCKED.</p>

<p>The number of bytes of the column value.</p>
<h4 id="remarks-32">Remarks</h4>
<p>If the SQL statement does not currently point to a valid row, or if the column index is out of range, the result is undefined. These functions may only be called when the most recent call to <strong>Step_</strong> has returned SQLITE_ROW and neither <strong>Reset</strong> nor <strong>Finalize</strong> have been called subsequently. If any of these functions are called after <strong>Reset</strong> or <strong>Finalize</strong> or after <strong>Step_</strong> has returned something other than SQLITE_ROW, the results are undefined. If <strong>Step_</strong> or <strong>Reset</strong> or <strong>Finalize</strong> are called from a different thread while <strong>ColumnBytes</strong> is pending, then the result is undefined.</p>
<p>If the result is a BLOB or UTF-8 string then the <strong>ColumnBytes</strong> function returns the number of bytes in that BLOB or string. If the result is a UTF-16 string, then <strong>ColumnBytes</strong> converts the string to UTF-8 and then returns the number of bytes. If the result is a numeric value then <strong>ColumnBytes</strong> uses <strong>snprintf</strong> to convert that value to a UTF-8 string and returns the number of bytes in that string. If the result is NULL, then <strong>ColumnBytes</strong> returns zero.</p>
<p>The values returned by <strong>ColumnBytes</strong> do not include the zero terminators at the end of the string. For clarity: the values returned by <strong>ColumnBytes</strong> are the number of bytes in the string, not the number of characters.</p>
<p>Note that when type conversions occur, pointers returned by prior calls to <strong>ColumnBlob</strong> and/or, <strong>ColumnText</strong> may be invalidated.</p>
<p>The safest and easiest to remember policy is to invoke these functions in one of the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>ColumnText</strong> followed by <strong>ColumnBytes</strong><br> <strong>ColumnBlob</strong> followed by <strong>ColumnBytes</strong></p>
<p>In other words, you should call <strong>ColumnText</strong> or <strong>ColumnBlob</strong> first to force the result into the desired format, then invoke <strong>ColumnBytes</strong> to find the size of the result.</p>
<p>The pointers returned are valid until a type conversion occurs as described above, or until <strong>Step_</strong> or <strong>Reset</strong> or <strong>Finalize</strong> is called. The memory space used to hold strings and BLOBs is freed automatically. Do not pass the pointers returned <strong>ColumnBlob</strong>, <strong>ColumnText</strong>, etc. into <strong>Free</strong>.</p>

<p>The column type.</p>
<h4 id="remarks-41">Remarks</h4>
<p>If the SQL statement does not currently point to a valid row, or if the column index is out of range, the result is undefined. <strong>ColumnType</strong> may only be called when the most recent call to <strong>Step_</strong> has returned SQLITE_ROW and neither <strong>Reset</strong> nor <strong>Finalize</strong> have been called subsequently. If any of these functions are called after <strong>Reset</strong> or <strong>Finalize</strong> or after <strong>Step_</strong> has returned something other than SQLITE_ROW, the results are undefined. If <strong>Step_</strong> or <strong>Reset</strong> or <strong>Finalize</strong> are called from a different thread while ColumnBytes is pending, then the result is undefined.</p>
<p>The <strong>ColumnType</strong> function returns the datatype code for the initial data type of the result column. The returned value is one of SQLITE_INTEGER, SQLITE_FLOAT, SQLITE_TEXT, SQLITE_BLOB, or SQLITE_NULL. The value returned by <strong>ColumnType</strong> is only meaningful if no type conversions have occurred as described below. After a type conversion, the value returned by <strong>ColumnType</strong> is undefined. Future versions of SQLite may change the behavior of <strong>ColumnType</strong> following a type conversion.</p>
<p>If the result is a BLOB or UTF-8 string then the <strong>ColumnBytes</strong> function returns the number of bytes in that BLOB or string. If the result is a UTF-16 string, then <strong>ColumnBytes</strong> converts the string to UTF-8 and then returns the number of bytes. If the result is a numeric value then <strong>ColumnBytes</strong> uses <strong>snprintf</strong> to convert that value to a UTF-8 string and returns the number of bytes in that string. If the result is NULL, then <strong>ColumnBytes</strong> returns zero.</p>
<p>If the result is a BLOB or UTF-16 string then the <strong>ColumnBytes</strong> function returns the number of bytes in that BLOB or string. If the result is a numeric value then <strong>ColumnBytes</strong> uses <strong>snprintf</strong> to convert that value to a UTF-16 string and returns the number of bytes in that string. If the result is NULL, then <strong>ColumnBytes</strong> returns zero.</p>
<p>The values returned by <strong>ColumnBytes</strong> do not include the zero terminators at the end of the string. For clarity: the values returned by <strong>ColumnBytes</strong> are the number of bytes in the string, not the number of characters.</p>
<p>Strings returned by <strong>ColumnText</strong>, even empty strings, are always zero-terminated. The return value from <strong>ColumnBlob</strong> for a zero-length BLOB is a NULL pointer.</p>
<p>These functions attempt to convert the value where appropriate. For example, if the internal representation is FLOAT and a text result is requested, snprintf is used internally to perform the conversion automatically. The following table details the conversions that are applied:</p>

<p>The table above makes reference to standard C library functions <strong>atoi</strong>() and <strong>atof</strong>(). SQLite does not really use these functions. It has its own equivalent internal functions. The <strong>atoi</strong>() and <strong>atof</strong>() names are used in the table for brevity and because they are familiar to most C programmers.</p>
<p>Note that when type conversions occur, pointers returned by prior calls to <strong>ColumnBlob</strong> and/or <strong>ColumnText</strong> may be invalidated. Type conversions and pointer invalidations might occur in the following cases:</p>
<p>The initial content is a BLOB and <strong>ColumnText</strong> is called. A zero-terminator might need to be added to the string.</p>
<p>The initial content is UTF-8 text and <strong>ColumnBytes</strong> or <strong>ColumnText</strong> is called. The content must be converted to UTF-16.</p>
<p>The safest and easiest to remember policy is to invoke these functions in one of the following ways:</p>

<p>In other words, you should call <strong>ColumnText</strong> or <strong>ColumnBlob</strong> first to force the result into the desired format, then invoke <strong>ColumnBytes</strong> to find the size of the result.</p>
<p>If a memory allocation error occurs during the evaluation of any of these functions, a default value is returned. The default value is either the integer 0, the floating point number 0.0, or a NULL pointer. Subsequent calls to <strong>ErrCode</strong> will return SQLITE_NOMEM.</p>
<h1 id="datacount"><a name="DataCount"></a>DataCount</h1>
<p>Returns the number of columns in the result set returned by the prepared statement. This function returns 0 if pStmt is an SQL statement that does not return data (for example an UPDATE).</p>
<pre><code>FUNCTION DataCount () AS LONG
</code></pre>
<h4 id="return-value-56">Return value</h4>
<p>The number of columns in the result set returned by the prepared statement.</p>
<h1 id="dbhandle"><a name="DbHandle"></a>DbHandle</h1>
<p>Returns the database connection handle to which a prepared statement belongs. The database connection returned by <strong>DbHandle</strong> is the same database connection that was the first argument to the <strong>Prepare</strong> call that was used to create the statement in the first place.</p>
<pre><code>FUNCTION DbHandle () AS sqlite3 PTR
</code></pre>
<h4 id="return-value-57">Return value</h4>
<p>The database connection handle to which a prepared statement belongs.</p>
<h1 id="finalize"><a name="Finalize"></a>Finalize</h1>
<p>Deletes a prepared statement.</p>
<pre><code>FUNCTION Finalize () AS LONG
</code></pre>
<h4 id="return-value-58">Return value</h4>
<p>If the most recent evaluation of the statement encountered no errors or if the statement is never been evaluated, then Finalize returns SQLITE_OK. If the most recent evaluation of a statement failed, then <strong>Finalize</strong> returns the appropriate error code or extended error code.</p>
<h4 id="remarks-42">Remarks</h4>
<p>The <strong>Finalize</strong> method can be called at any point during the life cycle of prepared statement: before statement is ever evaluated, after one or more calls to <strong>Reset</strong>, or after any call to <strong>Step_</strong> regardless of whether or not the statement has completed execution.</p>
<p>Invoking <strong>Finalize</strong> on a NULL pointer is a harmless no-op.</p>
<p>The application must finalize every prepared statement in order to avoid resource leaks. It is a grievous error for the application to try to use a prepared statement after it has been finalized. Any use of a prepared statement after it has been finalized can result in undefined and undesirable behavior such as segfaults and heap corruption.</p>
<h1 id="getrow"><a name="GetRow"></a>GetRow</h1>
<p>After a prepared statement has been prepared using either <strong>Prepare</strong> this method must be called one or more times to evaluate the statement. <strong>GetRow</strong> is an alias for <strong>Step_</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>FUNCTION GetRow () AS LONG
</code></pre>
<h4 id="return-value-59">Return value</h4>
<p><strong>SQLITE_BUSY</strong> means that the database engine was unable to acquire the database locks it needs to do its job. If the statement is a COMMIT or occurs outside of an explicit transaction, then you can retry the statement. If the statement is not a COMMIT and occurs within an explicit transaction then you should rollback the transaction before continuing.</p>
<p><strong>SQLITE_DONE</strong> means that the statement has finished executing successfully. <strong>Step_</strong> should not be called again on this virtual machine without first calling <strong>Reset</strong> to reset the virtual machine back to its initial state.</p>
<p>If the SQL statement being executed returns any data, then <strong>SQLITE_ROW</strong> is returned each time a new row of data is ready for processing by the caller. The values may be accessed using the column access functions. <strong>Step_</strong> is called again to retrieve the next row of data.</p>
<p><strong>SQLITE_ERROR</strong> means that a run-time error (such as a constraint violation) has occurred. <strong>GetRow</strong> should not be called again on the Virtual Machine. More information may be found by calling <strong>ErrMsg</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>SQLITE_MISUSE</strong> means that the this function was called inappropriately. Perhaps it was called on a prepared statement that has already been finalized or on one that had previously returned SQLITE_ERROR or SQLITE_DONE. Or it could be the case that the same database connection is being used by two or more threads at the same moment in time.</p>
<h4 id="remarks-43">Remarks</h4>
<p>For all versions of SQLite up to and including 3.6.23.1, a call to <strong>Reset</strong> was required after <strong>Step_</strong> returned anything other than SQLITE_ROW before any subsequent invocation of Step_. Failure to reset the prepared statement using <strong>Reset</strong> would result in an SQLITE_MISUSE return from <strong>Step_</strong>. But after version 3.6.23.1, <strong>Step_</strong> began calling <strong>Reset</strong> automatically in this circumstance rather than returning SQLITE_MISUSE. This is not considered a compatibility break because any application that ever receives an SQLITE_MISUSE error is broken by definition. The SQLITE_OMIT_AUTORESET compile-time option can be used to restore the legacy behavior.</p>
