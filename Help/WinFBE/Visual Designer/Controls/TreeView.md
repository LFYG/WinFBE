# How to use the TreeView

## Adding root and children nodes
The following example will create four root nodes. The fourth root node (Project 4), will have several children nodes. If the TreeView has the Sorted property set to True then the nodes and children nodes will automatically be sorted when they are added to the control.
```
dim as long root, node, subnode, subsubnode
root = frmMain.TreeView1.Nodes.Add("Project 1")
root = frmMain.TreeView1.Nodes.Add("Project 2")
root = frmMain.TreeView1.Nodes.Add("Project 13")
    
node = frmMain.TreeView1.Node(root).Nodes.Add("Project 6")
for i as long = 1 to 3
   subnode = frmMain.TreeView1.Node(root).Node(node).Nodes.Add("Project File" & i)
   for i as long = 1 to 2
      subsubnode = frmMain.TreeView1.Node(root).Node(node).Node(subnode).Nodes.Add("Sub Project File" & i)
      for i as long = 1 to 5
         frmMain.TreeView1.Node(root).Node(node).Node(subnode).Node(subsubnode).Nodes.Add("Sub Sub Project File" & i)
      next
   next
next
```
