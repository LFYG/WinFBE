| AllEvents | Special handler where all events are routed through. Use this handler if you prefer to use the Win32 api style messages and wParam and lParam parameters. Set the Handled element of EventArgs to true if you handle a message and do not want Windows to perform any further processing on the message.|
| Destroy | Occurs immediately before the control is about to be destroyed and all resources associated with it released.|
| Elapsed | Occurs when the Timer interval elapses.|


###
You do not have to kill or destroy a Timer. You simply need to StartTimer and StopTimer. The Timer resources are freed when StopTimer is called or the Form containing the Timer is closed.
